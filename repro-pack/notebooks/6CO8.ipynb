    "## Solvation energy of a Zika virus\n",

    "We present a more challenging problem that studies the solvation energy of the Zika virus (PDB code 6CO8).\n",
    "We ran this experiment on a single CPU node of Pegasus, and the raw result files are located at `/repro-pack/runs/6CO8`.\n",
    "This notebook shows how we generated the results in section 3.5, excluding the surface plot produced by ParaView.\n",
    "We downloaded the molecular structure from the Protein Data Bank (PDB), parameterized it with the amber force field, and generated a mesh on the solvent-excluded surface using Nanoshaper.\n",
    "The prepared structure contains about 1.6 million atoms and our mesh has around 10 million boundary elements.\n",
    "In this experiment, 3 quadrature points were used for regular Galerkin integrals over disjoint elements. The FMM expansion order was 4 and the tolerance of GMRES was $10^{-4}$."
